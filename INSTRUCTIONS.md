# Exercise 2: JavaScript / Node.js Fundamentals 🟨

> **Goal:** Learn the JavaScript basics you'll need for ~25% of tasks in the Product Track.
> After this exercise, you'll be comfortable with variables, functions, classes, arrays, objects, and error handling in JS.

## How This Exercise Works

1. Open `starter.js`
2. Read each section — it teaches you a concept with examples
3. Fill in the `TODO` sections
4. Run the tests to check your work:
   ```bash
   node test_exercise.js
   ```
5. Keep fixing until all tests pass ✅

## What You'll Learn

| # | Concept | Why You Need It |
|---|---------|-----------------|
| 1 | Variables (let, const) | Every program uses them |
| 2 | Functions & Arrow Functions | You'll read and fix functions in every task |
| 3 | Arrays | Data processing, queues, event lists |
| 4 | Objects | Configuration, API responses, data models |
| 5 | Classes | Task source code uses ES6 classes heavily |
| 6 | Error Handling (try/catch) | Production code must handle errors |
| 7 | Modules (require/export) | Node.js organizes code in modules |
| 8 | String Templates | Log messages, formatting |

## Key Differences from Python

| Python | JavaScript | 
|--------|-----------|
| `def greet(name):` | `function greet(name) {` |
| `self.name = name` | `this.name = name` |
| `True / False / None` | `true / false / null / undefined` |
| `print("hello")` | `console.log("hello")` |
| `# comment` | `// comment` |
| `len(list)` | `array.length` |
| `list.append(x)` | `array.push(x)` |
| Indentation matters | Curly braces `{}` matter |
